# OpenGov MCP Prototype - Project Notes

## üéâ CURRENT STATUS: FULLY FUNCTIONAL (July 2, 2025)

### ‚úÖ WORKING FEATURES:
- **Server:** Express server running on port 3000
- **API Integration:** Successfully connected to OpenGov API with X-API-Key header
- **Data Processing:** CSV parsing working correctly (10,646+ characters of real data)
- **Dashboard:** Complete procurement management interface with KPIs and analytics
- **Authentication:** API key `d459f6b45836b972a4fa3b454d23854b4a295d23ca188d1b94d8f147eae30ace` is functional

## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

### Server (server.js):
- Multiple authentication method testing
- CSV format detection and proper content-type handling
- Comprehensive error handling and debugging
- Mock data fallback when API fails

### Frontend (index.html):
- CSV to JSON parsing with column mapping
- Real-time KPI calculations
- Interactive filtering and analytics
- Risk assessment and alerts
- Professional procurement dashboard UI

### Key Fix Applied:
- **Problem:** Server was JSON-encoding CSV data, corrupting it
- **Solution:** Detect CSV format and return as `text/plain` instead of JSON
- **Result:** Frontend can now properly parse the CSV data

## üöÄ QUICK START:
1. `Get-Process node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force`
2. `npm start`
3. Open http://localhost:3000
4. Enter API key and click "Load Contracts"

## üìÅ BACKUP FILES CREATED:
- `WORKING-STATE-BACKUP.md` - Complete status documentation
- `server-WORKING-BACKUP.js` - Working server code backup
- This file updated with current status

## Previous Development History:

### Initial Setup (Before fixing):
- Created basic Express server with CORS
- Set up OpenGov API proxy endpoint
- Built procurement dashboard interface
- Implemented CSV parsing functionality

### Problems Encountered:
1. **Port conflicts** - Server wouldn't start due to EADDRINUSE errors
2. **API authentication** - Multiple failed attempts before finding X-API-Key works
3. **Data format issues** - CSV data was being corrupted by JSON encoding
4. **"Failed to fetch" errors** - Server stopping due to various issues

### Solutions Applied:
1. **Process management** - Kill existing node processes before starting
2. **Authentication testing** - Try multiple header formats, X-API-Key succeeded
3. **Content-type handling** - Detect CSV and return as text/plain
4. **Server stability** - Enhanced error handling and debugging

### API Discovery:
- Tested Bearer token authentication ‚ùå (401 Unauthorized)
- Tested API-Key header ‚ùå (403 Forbidden)  
- Tested X-API-Key header ‚úÖ (200 Success with 10,646 chars of CSV data)
- OpenGov API returns CSV format, not JSON as initially expected

### Dashboard Evolution:
- Started as basic contract list
- Evolved into comprehensive procurement management system
- Added KPIs, vendor analysis, status distribution, filtering
- Implemented risk assessment and compliance alerts
- Professional UI with gradients, hover effects, responsive design

## üìä Current Data Flow:
```
Browser ‚Üí Express Server ‚Üí OpenGov API (CSV) ‚Üí CSV Parser ‚Üí Dashboard Analytics
```

The system now successfully loads real contract data and presents it in a professional procurement management interface suitable for contract managers and procurement professionals.
